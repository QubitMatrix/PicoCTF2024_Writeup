# Description
I wrote you a [song](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/0e21e3ca94779f56b122296424e879f8/lyrics.txt). Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

# Solution
- Hint suggests it is some rockstar music. on searching for ctf related tools for rockstar music -> this [link](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) is a rockstar interpreter which converts a rock music lyrics to text
- The interpreter gives some integers which when pasted on cyberchef gives a word which is the flag
- Flag -> `picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}`
