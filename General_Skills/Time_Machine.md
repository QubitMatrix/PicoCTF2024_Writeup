# Description
What was I last working on? I remember writing a note to help me remember...

# Solution
- writing a note hints at using some sort of version control, notes can be a specific commit to describe what the author was working on
- `git log` -> to show all commits, there is only one commit and the commit message directly gives the flag.
- Flag -> picoCTF{t1m3m@ch1n3_<some_id>}
