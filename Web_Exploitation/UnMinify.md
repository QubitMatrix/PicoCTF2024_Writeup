# Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!   
Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:55033/), and find the flag!

# Solution
- Minification would mean the flag is somewhere in the source code but the code is not very readable
- `curl http://titan.picoctf.net:55033/ | grep picoCTF` -> will highlight 3 entries and one of those is the flag
- Flag -> picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_<some_id>}
