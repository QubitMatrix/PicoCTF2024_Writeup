# Solution
- The hint suggests that there is some kind of issue in the way the server parses the user input and validates it, there are multiple ways to bypass this check
1. Check if the server checks only the existing content-type by changing the content-type (even removing a single letter works) -> the OTP check is bypassed as the server just checks for the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content-type and allows any other type to bypass OTP
2. Another way to bypass the OTP will be to remove the OTP request parameter all together and send the request (change it through the request body parameters fields as just removing it from the raw request body will not work)
