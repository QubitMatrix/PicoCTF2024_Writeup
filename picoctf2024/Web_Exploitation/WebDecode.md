# Description
Do you know how to use the web inspector?   
Start searching [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:54494/) to find the flag

# Solution
- It can be gathered from the hints that the flag need not be directly visible hence we cannot search for picoCTF directly
- It also hints at looking at other pages linked to the home page -> on analyzing there are 3 html files `index.html`, `about.html` and `contact.html` 
- Inspect each of these pages, this `notify_true` part of about.html looks suspicious and on trying to decode it using magic mode in cyberchef the flag is revealed (encoding was base64)
