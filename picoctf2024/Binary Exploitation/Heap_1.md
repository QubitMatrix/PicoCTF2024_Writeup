# Solution
- Difference between the input location and the heap area where the safe variable stored is hex(20) or 32 in decimals -> entering any 32 characters followed by pico can make the safe variable change to pico using heap overflow
- input => `11111111111111111111111111111111pico`
- Flag -> `picoCTF{starting_to_get_the_hang_<someid>}`
