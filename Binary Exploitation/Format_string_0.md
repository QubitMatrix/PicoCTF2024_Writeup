# Solution
- For the first customer it can be seen that only one option has format specifiers - `Gr%114d_Cheese`
- Bob wants to **break** the shop - hints at crashing the program -> %s is usually used to crash the program since it can't try to access invalid or protected memory and cause segmentation fault 
- `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` can be chosen to **break** the shop
- Flag -> `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_<some-id>}`
