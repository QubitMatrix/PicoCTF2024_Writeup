# Solution
- Difference between the input location and the heap area where the safe varaible stored is hex(20) or 32 in decimals -> entering any 32 characters followed by pico can make the safe variable change to pico using heap overflow
- input => `11111111111111111111111111111111pico`
- Flag -> `picoCTF{my_first_heap_overflow_<some_id>}`
