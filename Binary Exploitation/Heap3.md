# Description
This program mishandles memory. Can you exploit it to get the flag? Download the binary [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_tethys/6/chall). Download the source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_tethys/6/chall.c).

# Solution
- On running the netcat command the first line hints at the **Use After Free** vulnerability
- If the size of new allocated object is same as freed object that address will be reallocated
	- since the code is freeing the structure but no measures are taken to avoid this vulnerability 
	- (x is not set to null after free -> the data is erased and address freed but x still points to the address -> which means we can carefully craft input to allocate the same address and manipulate it to change values of x)  
- Original x consisted of 35 bytes hence we request for new allocation 35 bytes
- Exploit
	- Free x
	- Allocate object with size as 35
	- Give the data as any 30 characters followed by pico
	- Print the flag by choosing check for win
- Flag -> `picoCTF{now_thats_free_real_estate_<some_id>}`
